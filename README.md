# Machine Learning Workshop Projects

This repository contains various machine learning projects and analyses focused on HR analytics and payroll modeling. The projects demonstrate practical applications of machine learning in business contexts.

## Projects

### 1. Employee Attrition and Performance Analysis
Located in: `/employee-attrition-and-performance/`

This project analyzes IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance dataset to:
- Identify factors contributing to employee attrition
- Analyze correlations between various HR metrics
- Create predictive models for employee attrition
- Visualize key insights using seaborn and matplotlib

Key features analyzed include:
- Employee demographics
- Job-related factors
- Performance metrics
- Work environment variables

### 2. Payroll Modeling
Located in: `/payroll-modelling/`

A machine learning approach to payroll analysis and prediction.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Anaconda (recommended) or pip for package management
